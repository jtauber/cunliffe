# Exploring Cunliffe

1. Cunliffe.html downloaded from Internet Archive https://archive.org/details/CunliffeHomericLexicon
2. stripped HTML wrapper to make cunliffe.orig (copied to cunliffe.txt)
3. made corrections to cunliffe.txt as later steps failed
4. ran process1.py to make out1.html (initially exploring formatting)
5. ran process2.py to make out2.txt
6. ran process3.py to make out3.html (exploring formatting in out2.txt)
7. running process4.py and still dealing with errors
